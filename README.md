# SootUp library ![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/soot-oss/SootUp/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg?branch=develop) ![Coverage](.github/badges/jacoco.svg)

This is the home of the **SootUp** project.
A complete overhaul of the good, old static analysis framework [Soot](https://github.com/soot-oss/soot).

## What is SootUp
- Transforms JVM bytecode (and other inputs!) to the intermediate representation Jimple.
- ClassHierarchy generation
- CallGraph generation with different algorithms/precisions
- Inter-procedural Data-flow Analysis with the IDE/IFDS framework enabled by [Heros](https://github.com/Sable/heros))
- Applys/Enables simple transformations on retrieving a methods Body (see BodyInterceptor)
- Provides serialization of the Jimple IR.

## SootUp improvements 
#### (compared to its predecessor [Soot](https://github.com/soot-oss/soot).)
- [x] New Improved API (without Globals/Singletons)
- [x] Fully-Parallelizable Architecture
- [x] Enables lazyloading of classes (no interleaved loading of used/dependend classes anymore)
- [x] Fail early strategy - input validation while constructing/building objects
- [x] Up-to-Date (i.e. Java8!) Sourcecode Frontend
- [x] Full Java 17 Support for Bytecode
- [x] Multiple Views (Scenes)
- [ ] Full-Diff Support for Classes (across different View instances)
- [x] Immutable Jimple IR Objects and Graphs
- [ ] Incremental Updates of Program Representation
