- SootUp framework transforms JVM bytecode to the intermediate representation Jimple.
- ClassHierarchy generation
- CallGraph generation with different algorithms/precisions
- IDE/IFDS solving (enabled by [Heros](https://github.com/Sable/heros))
- Applys/Enables simple transformations on retrieving a methods Body (BodyInterceptor)
- Provides serialization of the Jimple IR.
